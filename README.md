Redis Simple Protocol (RESP)

This is a simple, but functional implementation of [Redis Simple Protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol#:~:text=Redis%20clients%20communicate%20with%20the,Simple%20to%20implement.)
Implemented by custom serde datatype. Even with fact that I made this by myself, all credits goes to [serde-RESP](https://github.com/DEDZTBH/serde-RESP) perfect crate.
For examples look on tests in `ser` and `de` module.
